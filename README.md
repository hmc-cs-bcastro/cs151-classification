Which Digit?

Which action?


### <a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction

In this project, you will design three classifiers: a perceptron classifier, a large-margin (MIRA) classifier, and a slightly modified perceptron classifier for behavioral cloning. You will test the first two classifiers on a set of scanned handwritten digit images, and the last on sets of recorded pacman games from various agents. Even with simple features, your classifiers will be able to do quite well on these tasks when given enough training data.

Optical character recognition ([OCR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)) is the task of extracting text from image sources. The data set on which you will run your classifiers is a collection of handwritten numerical digits (0-9). This is a very commercially useful technology, similar to the technique used by the US post office to route mail by zip codes. There are systems that can perform with over 99% classification accuracy (see [LeNet-5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/index.html) for an example system in action).

Behavioral cloning is the task of learning to copy a behavior simply by observing examples of that behavior. In this project, you will be using this idea to mimic various pacman agents by using recorded games as training examples. Your agent will then run the classifier at each action in order to try and determine which action would be taken by the observed agent.

The code for this project includes the following files and data, available as a [zip file](https://github.com/HEATlab/cs151-classification/archive/master.zip).

**Files to Edit and Submit:** You will fill in portions of [perceptron.py](https://github.com/HEATlab/cs151-classification/blob/master/perceptron.py), [mira.py](https://github.com/HEATlab/cs151-classification/blob/master/mira.py), [answers.py](https://github.com/HEATlab/cs151-classification/blob/master/answers.py),[perceptron_pacman.py](https://github.com/HEATlab/cs151-classification/blob/master/perceptron_pacman.py), and [dataClassifier.py](https://github.com/HEATlab/cs151-classification/blob/master/dataClassifier.py) (only) during the assignment, and submit them. You should submit these files with your code and comments. Please _do not_ change the other files in this distribution or submit any of our original files other than this file.

**Evaluation:** Your code will be autograded for technical correctness. Please _do not_ change the names of any provided functions or classes within the code, or you will wreak havoc on the autograder. However, the correctness of your implementation -- not the autograder's judgements -- will be the final judge of your score. If necessary, we will review and grade assignments individually to ensure that you receive due credit for your work.

**Academic Dishonesty:** We will be checking your code against other submissions in the class for logical redundancy. If you copy someone else's code and submit it with minor changes, we will know. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool, so please don't try. We trust you all to submit your own work only; _please_ don't let us down. If you do, we will pursue the strongest consequences available to us.

**Getting Help:** You are not alone! If you find yourself stuck on something, contact the course staff for help. Office hours, section, and the discussion forum are there for your support; please use them. If you can't make our office hours, let us know and we will schedule more. We want these projects to be rewarding and instructional, not frustrating and demoralizing. But, we don't know when or how to help unless you ask.

**Discussion:** Please be careful not to post spoilers.
